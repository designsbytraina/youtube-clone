## YouTube Clone
##### Check out [Stephen Grider's React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) course on Udemy.

#### Running the App

Clone this repository.

```sh
$ git clone [https://github.com...repo.git] [YOUR_DIRECTORY]
```

Get a [YouTube API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) and replace it in the `./src/API_KEY.js` file. 

_Note: I have left my API key to get the project started without needing to obtain your own._

Run the application at `localhost:8080` using:

```sh
$ npm start
```

_Tests to be added later._
